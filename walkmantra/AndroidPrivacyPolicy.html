<h2>WalkMantra: Privacy policy</h2>

<p>Welcome to the WalkMantra app for Android!</p>

<p>This is an Android app developed by Anil Poosarla.</p>

<p>As an end user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
  I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.</p>

<h3>Data collected by the app</h3>

<p>I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, we only collect firstName, lastName, email, age, gender, language preference and country at the time of registration, we are storing the walk duration that the user is entering. No analytics software is present in the app.</p>

<p>The App uses the login credentials to authenticate. The authentication is performed in backend and might store information in log files that user has logged in to the App for debugging purposes. No other data is collected or tracked in the App itself.</p>

<h3>Explanation of permissions requested in the app</h3>

<p>The list of permissions required by the app:</p>

<br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Permission</th>
    <th>Why it is required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><code>android.permission.WAKE_LOCK</code></td>
    <td>A wake lock is a mechanism to indicate that your application needs to have the device stay on. This is needed for audio playback.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><code>android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE</code></td>
    <td>Enables the app to create foreground services that can play audio. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><code>android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK</code></td>
    <td>This permission allows audio to play even when phone is locked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code></td>
    <td>This allows App to connect to backend server to authenticate the user.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<hr>

<p>If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email, and I will surely try to fix it or help you.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
